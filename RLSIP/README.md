2. Make sure to also have **Git** installed so you you can pull my code
    1. Open the command line.
    2. Type `cd <Folder where you want to push your code path>`
    3. Type  `git clone <Link of the online git repository> `
    4. Type `git pull`
3. Once you have the code saved locally, make sure Visual Studio code is in the right folder (make sure it in the correct file path).
4. Type into the **Visual Studio Code terminal** the following to install the required modules:
    1. `pip install pygame`
